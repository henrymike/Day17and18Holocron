## Day 17 & 18 Homework - Part 1
### Holocron (Prototype & Development)

The Star Wars universe is massive. It includes a huge number of people So massive that a team of Jedi (and Jedi-wannabes) built Wookieepedia to manage it all. Unfortunately, the interface is a bit outdated and not terribly mobile-friendly. So, the Jedi Council (James & I) has hired you to build the Holocron.

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* Your fellow padawan in the Ruby class will create an API for you based on [Wookieepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)
* The MVP of the Holocron will only include characters from the universe (not planets, vehicles, etc)
* The Holocron should be fully searchable. You will decide what content to include, but it should at least include name and an image. Do not limit yourself to those items. You can include whatever you find.
* How the Holocron appears and what it can do are totally up to you.

MINIMUM requirements for Day 17
* A core list of features for your MVP and a list of features for later versions.
* Build out a "working" prototype using Balsamiq. 

MINIMUM requirements for Day 18
* Build the front end of the Holocron that works with your fellow padawan's API

## Day 18 Homework - Part 2
### Weekly News

A significant part of being a developer is keeping up with technology, especially in mobile, and particularly in iOS. We get significant changes at least 2x a year (one for hardware and one for software), and sometimes even more often. It's difficult, if not impossible, to keep up. One way to try to keep up is to keep tabs on the weekly news. So, every week you will have an assignment to find an article and share it with the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Find a _unique_, _recent_ news article and share it to the iOS class on Slack
* UNIQUE: You must be the first to share that topic on Slack. A similar article on the same topic does not count.
* RECENT: It must be from the last 7 days, ideally within the last few days
* I am the ultimate arbiter of unique & recent
* Be prepared to discuss your (and everyone else's article) in the next lecture

## Day 18 Homework - Part 3
### Blog Post

Learning is not just about participating in a lecture & doing your homework. Learning takes reflection. So, every week part of your homework will be to write a blog post. The topic of each post is up to you. It can be a reflection on how you are feeling in class at that moment. It can be an instruction guide for others on how to do something we covered in class. It can be a summary of the things we've covered in class. It can be your opinions about recent news in mobile. It should be something that is either directly or tangentially related to the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* If you don’t have a blog, start one. If you have one, use that. Suggested Blog Sites: Medium, WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, etc.
* Write what ever you want. Suggested Topics: how you're feeling about class, a summary of topics for the week, creating a tutorial for a particular topic, a summary of weekly mobile news, etc.
* When you’re done, post it and send me a link. If you want to keep it private, that’s fine just show me that it's posted.
