# Holocron

### How It Works
A Star Wars character search tool. Data was scraped from a Wiki site, stored on Heroku, and provided in a JSON file. Users are able to filter results by factions, view details on the character, and link to a full webpage for more info.

### Features
* Search by faction (Jedi, Sith, Rebels, Empire) via a Tab Bar controller that dynamically updates search string based on selection
* Loading animation to provide visual confirmation to user that background activity is occurring during search
* Table View with name/photo can be selected for brief bio in a detail View Controller
* Link to full character page on Wiki displayed within app


### Future
* Include additional characters/vehicles from the Star Wars universe
* Add speech-to-text functionality to allow you to say a name and return relevant results
